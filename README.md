_Overcoming problems of agreeing on taboo stuff_

Well, sometimes you are too afraid to ask someone out on a date. Or sex. Or chat and cuddle.

This ...thing?... aims to kinda-sort-of solve this.

## Scope

It has to be able to notify me if mine intentions and someone elses are aligned.
E.g if we both want to go poison pigeons.
Discovery is a different problem.

Right now I guess that would be a tg bot.

## Ideas and problems

### Freetext intentions

If freetext intentions are allowed, they may be used for spam, and if freetext is publicly transmitted to identify sender (e.g by specificity or writing style).

So, if someone wants to `wibble-wobble` and some other human wants to `wibbleWobble` — I have no idea how to match that.

So curated list of intentions it is.

### Roles in intention

If roles in those intentions — e.g dom/sub pair — are relevant — then create two roles and sort participants by id.

### Private intersection

Keeping data in public would mean that you will be able to check intentions without posting yours — so some third party is required. (?)
